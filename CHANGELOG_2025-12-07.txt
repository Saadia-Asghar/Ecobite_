CHANGELOG - December 7, 2025

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
==================

1. FEATURES & ENHANCEMENTS
--------------------------
   A. User Roles & Signup Flow
      - Implemented a new "Category Selection" step in the Signup process.
      - Users now first select whether they are a "Donor" (Give food) or "Beneficiary" (Receive food).
      - Role selection is now filtered based on the chosen category:
         * Donors: Individual, Restaurant.
         * Beneficiaries: NGO, Animal Shelter, Waste Management (Fertilizer).
      - Updated the User data structure to include this new `category` field.

   B. Role-Based Access Control
      - Restricted the "Claim Donation" functionality.
      - The "Claim" button is now HIDDEN for 'Individual' and 'Restaurant' (Donor) accounts.
      - Only Beneficiary roles (NGOs, Shelters, etc.) can now claim donations.
      - Applied this logic to both the main Donations List and the Nearby NGOs view.

   C. Admin Dashboard
      - Added a new "Category" column to the Users Management table.
      - Admins can now clearly see if a user is registered as a "Donor" or "Beneficiary".

2. BUG FIXES & CONFIGURATION
----------------------------
   A. UI/UX Loading Issue
      - Fixed an issue where the UI/UX styling was not loading in production deployments (Vercel).
      - Cause: Mismatch between ESM-style config files (tailwind.config.js, postcss.config.js) and the project's CommonJS default.
      - Fix: Added `"type": "module"` to `package.json` to ensure build tools correctly process the configuration and generate CSS.

   B. Mock Data Updates
      - Updated mock users to include the new `category` field for testing purposes.
      - Extended mock expiry dates for test donations to ensure they appear as "Available".

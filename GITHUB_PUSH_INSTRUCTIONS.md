   - Click **"Allow secret"**

2. **Second secret:**

   - Click **"Allow secret"**

### **Step 2: Push Again**

After allowing both secrets, run:

```bash
git push origin main
```

## 🔒 SECURITY NOTE

The secrets in the old commit are:
- Already redacted in current files
- In documentation (not actual credentials)
- Safe to allow for push

After pushing, consider:
- Rotating any real credentials
- Using GitHub Secrets for production
- Keeping .env files in .gitignore

**Once you allow the secrets, everything will push successfully!** 🚀

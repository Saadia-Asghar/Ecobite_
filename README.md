## 🌟 Key Features

### 👁️ AI-Powered Quality Assurance
Never guess freshness again. Our integrated **Azure AI Vision** system automatically detects food types and calculates freshness scores from uploaded photos, ensuring only high-quality food reaches the community.

### 🗺️ Real-Time Smart Logistics
Visualize the impact in real-time. Built with **Azure Maps**, our interactive dashboard connects Restaurants, NGOs, and Individuals through a live spatial interface that tracks donation hotspots and pickup requests.

### 💰 EcoPoints Ecosystem
Every bite counts. Users earn **EcoPoints** for every action that reduces waste. These points track your personal contribution to reducing CO2 emissions and can be used to unlock rewards and community recognition.

### 🔐 Enterprise-Grade Security
Your data is protected by the same technology powering the world's largest companies. We use **Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD)** for secure, seamless authentication across all user roles.

### 📈 Manual Payment Verification
Transparency first. Our donation system supports multiple payment methods (JazzCash, EasyPaisa, Card) with a manual verification workflow. Users upload payment proofs, which are reviewed by admins to ensure integrity and award EcoPoints fairly.

### 📊 Multi-Role Ecosystem
Specialized dashboards tailored for:
- **Restaurants & Food Businesses**: Efficiently list surplus and track tax-deductible contributions.
- **NGOs & Animal Shelters**: Request specific food types and manage distribution.
- **Individuals**: Donate surplus meals and volunteer for local pickups.
- **Fertilizer Plants**: Receive non-consumable waste for organic composting.
